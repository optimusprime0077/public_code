# Project Topics

This document outlines two main topics, Machine Learning and SQL, each with associated sub-topics. Each sub-topic links to corresponding files. These are projects I worked on by myself, individually, with no team participation.

## Machine Learning

Explore projects in machine learning, showcasing various concepts and techniques. All files are located in the `Python_machineLearning` folder.
